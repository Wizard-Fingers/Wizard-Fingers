# 🎨 Art Beckett: Just Your Friendly Neighborhood Dislexic Developer 😄

## 🌟 Crafting Digital Experiences and Trying to Keep Up with the Cool Kids 🌟

---

Hey there! I'm Art Beckett, a 30-something dad who happens to be a web developer. I've been tinkering with code for over 3 years now, and I've had some pretty neat experiences along the way. I even ran my own little studio in Swindon, UK for a bit! It's been a wild ride, but I'm always excited to help folks out with their online presence. 😊

## 🎭 Behind the Code: Just a Dad Trying to Make Cool Stuff 🎭

I'm not some fancy-schmancy web developer with a PhD in computer science. I'm just a regular guy who loves to create and has a knack for coding. I've picked up a thing or two over the years, and I always try to bring a bit of my own style and creativity to my work. But at the end of the day, my biggest inspiration comes from my amazing wife of 13 years and our two incredible kids. They keep me grounded and remind me of what's truly important in life. 💖

### 🌈 When I'm Not Coding, You Can Find Me... 🌈

- 🌿 Exploring the great outdoors with my family, one hiking trail at a time.
- ✍️ Attempting to write stories that my kids will enjoy (and maybe even think are cool).
- 🚀 Geeking out over the latest sci-fi books and movies.
- 🎮 Playing video games with my kids and pretending I know what I'm doing.
- 🕹️ Trying to build video games with my kids (and learning a lot in the process).
- 🎨 Doodling animals and landscapes during our family vacations.
- 📝 Slowly but surely building my own little corner of the internet through my blog and social media.

I've been working on some pretty neat projects lately, and I'm excited to share one of them with you:

### 🏜️ Off Road Fun Finder: My First Real-World Coding Adventure! 🏜️

Off Road Fun Finder was my first taste of what it's like to code in the real world, and it was quite the adventure! I dove headfirst into the project, working on everything from the sign-in forms to the product info and even the admin panel. I also got to flex my design muscles by creating the logo and collaborating with some other awesome developers. It was a ton of fun, and it'll always hold a special place in my coding journey. 💪
